# Whole-Genome-Sequencing-analysis

This reporsitory contains snakemake scripts to 
(1) Align Whole-genome sequencing fastq files to a genome and preprocess the subsequent bam file appropriately for downstream analysis.                                  
(2) Call SNV/MNV and InDel variants.
(3) Call copy number variants.

All scripts are written using the snakemake workflow management system for reproducibility and scalability when working with large sample sizes.

All scripts are written using GATK best practices.
